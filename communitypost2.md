Last week, Carmichael residence hall hosted a small training session that involved the basics of web design. Although we have already touched on designing websites in this class, I decided to attend to see if they would offer anything new or different that I could learn. 

During this training session, the instructors mentioned a few sites that allow people to create websites for free using templates and easy customization with no coding knowledge necessary. Some of the websites mentioned were Google Sites, Wix, and Wordpress. They also touched on the basics of using html and css to create and design websites form scratch. 

It was interesting to learn about the different sites that allow anyone to create a website for free. I had already worked with google sites once for a class project, but it's nice to know I have many other options if I ever need to create a website and want an easier option for doing it. These websites all have premade templates but also allow you to choose your own design, such as choosing customized placement of titles and text and photos. These sort of website design companies also make it easy to customize colors and fonts. Instead of editing a css file, they have user-friendly menus of color and font options that a user can easily select from. 

Most of the html and css mentioned in this session were things that I had already seen before in this class or elsewhere, but they did focus a little more on how to start a website design instead of editing a premade template like we did for this class. The instructors explained the head and body tags of html as well as titles, headers, and images. During th practiced these skills by opening a simple text editor program and created a basic "Hello World" page that was pretty much a blank white page with the text "hello world". Since this html file wasn't on a hosting site, it was just a local webpage that can be viewed in a browser. 

Overall, I think that this was an interesting event to attend. Although some of the material was a repeat of things I've already learned, I did leave the session with new knowledge as well.
