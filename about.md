<h2>About</h2>
<p>My name is Grace and I never have many interesting things to say on about me pages so this should be fairly short.
I'm a sophomore at UNC Chapel Hill and I'm majoring in computer science and minoring in information science. 
I was born in Fayetteville, NC and have lived in this state my entire life. I'm Filipino and can <i>kind of</i>  mostly speak the language, just nothing complicated. 
<br><br>
My free time mostly involve wasting time on the internet and social media, listening to music, watching shows and movies, spending time with friends, and eating food.
The music I listen to goes from pop to rap to acoustic to pop punk to anything else, and I watch different shows and movies, 
but scifi/fantasy and superhero are probably my favorite. 
I could list all the singers and bands I listen to and all the shows and movies I like, but I won't because it would 
be a really long list. Just know there's a lot. There's not much else about me that I can write on this page, so I'm just gonna end this here.</p>
