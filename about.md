<h2>About</h2>
<p>My name is Grace and I never have many interesting things to say on about me pages so this should be fairly short.
I'm a sophomore at UNC Chapel Hill and I'm majoring in computer science and minoring in information science. 
I was born in NC and have lived here my entire life. 
My hobbies mostly involve wasting time on the internet, listening to music, and watching shows and movies.</p>
