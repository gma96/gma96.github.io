It's been a little over a month since I've started my sophomore year at UNC and enrolled in this class called INLS 161. A month may seem like a short amount of time, but a lot can be learned in a small time frame. Here is a summary of what I've learned so far. 

I'm a computer science major, and I've heard about github and have even downloaded files from the site in my past classes, but I never really knew exactly what it was or what you could do with it. This class has expanded my knowledge about github and has allowed me to gain experience with using the website. This class has also given me an introduction to linux and linux commands. Coincidentally, I'm also learning and using linux commands in another class that I am taking this semester, so it's helpful that the things I'm learning in this class are also helping me in other classes and might also potentially be useful in my future career in computer science. 

Here are some basic commonly-used linux commands that I've learned in this class. 


{% highlight ruby %}
cd      #changes directory  
pwd     #prints working directory
ls      #lists contents of directory
{% endhighlight %}

For more information on linux, [this resource][this] provides a great overview of different commands.

Moreover, I've learned the basics of creating and editing websites using html, css, and markdown and how to display websites on github. Its a likely possibility that I might have to create or work with websites in my future career, so its good that I'm learning these useful skills in this class. Overall, I think the things I've learned in this class and the things that I'm going to learn in this class in the future are helpful skills and will help me succeed in other classes and in the future.
