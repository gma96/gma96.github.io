Earlier last week, UNC's computer science department hosted an event featuring Britt Hykal, a current associate recruiting coordinator at Google.
She stopped by Sitterson Hall for coffee and to discuss her current career, provide tips and advice, and answer any questions that students may have. 

Google is a very well-known and prominent company in today's society, so it was very interesting to listen to the 
experiences of someone who is employed by such a popular company. Also, as a computer science major, it is always a positive 
learning experience to hear what someone who works for a company that is in the same career field has to say.

A large portion of her career is overseeing the experiences and qualifications and conducting the interviewing process
of new potential employees, and it was a good opportunity to be able to hear what Google usually looks for in a new employee
from someone who has first hand experiences in the hiring process. 

I don't know where I will be working after I graduate from college, and although Google will probably be a very distant and 
unlikely possibility, I will most likely be working for a company, who like Google, also deals with technology, and will
probably be looking for candidates that have similar skills and experiences as what Google is looking for. Overall, I think this 
event was a positve experience, and I hope that hearing Britt Hykal's experiences and advice will help me with my future of working in a similar field as her.
